    <h1>A Softcover Book Report</h1>
    <h3>Moby-Dick (or, The Whale)</h3>
    <p>
        The <a href=" https://www.softcover.io/" onclick="window.open('softcover.io','_blank');">Softcover</a>
        publiching platform was designed mainly for ebooks like some of the popular IT textbooks but it's also good for
        making more traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as
        <em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below a short and affectionately irrelevant book report on this classic of
        American literature.

            onclick="window.open('softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick');">Moby Dick</a> by Herman Melville begins with
        this immortal words:

    <blockquote>
        Call me Ishmael. Some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
        particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.
        It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
    </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
        After driving off his spleen (which can't be good for you), Ishmael the goes on in much the same vain for
        approximately one jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who &mdash; <em>spoiler alert!</em>
        &mdash; is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
